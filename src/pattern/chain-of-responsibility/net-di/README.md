.NET Dependency Injection

## Note

### 1.

This is a sample implementation of the Chain of Responsibility pattern using .NET Dependency Injection (DI). 
To avoid referencing the Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting package, I created an interface that simulates integration with the .NET dependency injection framework.

### 2.

This implementation is similar to this [repository](https://github.com/esavini/cor-di), 
well It is mostly a copy of that implementation with some really really minor changes.

### 3.

I added this mostly as a template / reference when integrating chain of responsibility pattern to .NET projects I am working and will be working on.
